# dstlled-diff action

‚ú® Overview
---

`dstlled-diff` (short for "distilled-diff") is a GitHub action that processes a
specific git revision range and generates a diff that only includes changes in
the signatures of various code constructs (such as classes, functions, and
objects, etc.). It is powered by [dstll][1].

The main goal of `dstlled-diff` is to simplify the review of structural code
changes by removing diff components that do not alter signatures.

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

```yaml
name: dstlled-diff

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  dstlled-diff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - id: get-dstlled-diff
        uses: dhth/dstlled-diff-action@v0.1.0
        with:
          starting-commit: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
          ending-commit: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          post-comment-on-pr: 'true'
```

The "dstlled-diff" will be available as an output of the action, via
`steps.get-dstlled-diff.outputs.diff`.
